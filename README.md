*We used Clean Architecture + MVP*  
There are 3 reasons why we decided to use MVP pattern

1. Clear separation of responsibilities between components. Activity and Fragment tend to get bigger If we do not use   
2. architecture. MVP allows for an easier understanding and maintenance of the project.  
3. Re-usability.since we can have multiple presenters to control views, we can reuse codes for different views. 
Easy to unit-testing  

# My Task
Organize everyone's tasks and make a plan. Implement main page which has scholarship infomations,  purchasing raffle tickets and Student goals with Recyclerview, Edit profile page and bug fixes.
