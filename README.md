We used Clean Architecture + MVP  
There are 3 reasons why we decided to use MVP pattern

1. Clear separation of responsibilities between components. Activity and Fragment tend to get bigger If we don't use architecture. MVP allows programmers for an easier understanding and maintenance of the project.  
2. Re-usability.since we can have multiple presenters to control views, we can reuse codes for different views.   
3. Easy to unit-testing
